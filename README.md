## Task
Analysing the data involved getting as much infomation from the data avilable. This was achieved from importing, spliting, and converting strings to integers, by doing that i was able to get:

- The number of players visiting the club for a day
- The number of players visiting the club for a week
- The probable maximum number of games played in a day
- The probable maximum number of games played in a day
 

## Features
-Input_new_data: Prompts the user to manually enter new data for players and games for each day over a week.
-Choice of Data Source: The user can choose between fetching data from Google Sheets or manually entering new data.
-Processing and Calculation: The calculating_max_totals and calculate_daily_statistics functions use either the fetched or manually input data to perform calculations and display results.
